# QuikGraph

## What is **QuikGraph**?

QuikGraph provides generic directed/undirected graph data structures and algorithms for .NET.

QuikGraph comes with algorithms such as depth first search, breath first search, A* search, shortest path, k-shortest path, maximum flow, minimum spanning tree, etc.

*QuikGraph was originally created by Jonathan "Peli" de Halleux in 2003 and named QuickGraph.*

It was then updated to become YC.QuickGraph.

**This version** of QuickGraph, renamed **QuikGraph**, is a fork of YC.QuickGraph, and I tried to clean the library to provide it as a clean NuGet packages using modern C# development (.NET Core).

The library has been cleaned and improved. It comes with a lot of fixes for issues of the original library.

## Targets

- [![.NET Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET%20Standard-%3E%3D%201.3-blue.svg)](#)
- [![.NET Core](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET%20Core-%3E%3D%201.0-blue.svg)](#)
- [![.NET Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET%20Framework-%3E%3D%203.5-blue.svg)](#)

Supports Source Link (use dedicated symbol package)

To get it working you need to:
- Uncheck option "Enable Just My Code"
- Add the NuGet symbol server (*https://symbols.nuget.org/download/symbols*)
- Check option "Enable Source Link support"

## Contributing

### Build

* Clone this repository.
* Open QuikGraph.sln.

### Notes

The library get rid of PEX that was previously used for unit tests and now uses NUnit3 (not published).

I would be very pleased to receive pull requests to further **test**, **improve** or add new features to the library.
