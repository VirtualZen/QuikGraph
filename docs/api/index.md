# API Reference

Welcome to the **QuikGraph** library API Reference!

The library provides graph structures and algorithms to be apply on graphs such as shortest path finder, topological sorts, hamiltonian and eulerian checks, and many other algorithms.

Main entry points of the library are its data structures under namespace `QuikGraph` and its algorithms under namespace `QuikGraph.Algorithms`.
